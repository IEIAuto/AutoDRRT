# Level 4 Autonomous Driving Solution for Factory Scenarios
This solution is an L4-level autonomous driving solution designed for factory scenarios. Developed based on AutoDRRT, the solution is capable of adapting to scenarios involving obstacles, smoke, S-curves, L-curves, and more. It primarily features the following characteristics:

## Features

- safety

In an environment where humans and robots work together, the robot must be able to prevent accidents when encountering workers who emerge from the shadows of equipment, detect leftover objects placed inadvertently in the passageway, and stop safely and reliably. The robot must be able to detect unintentionally placed objects in the passageway and stop safely and reliably.

- availability
  
 Automated systems used in factory automatic transfers are required to have both low vehicle cost and high task processing capacity. Therefore, they must be able to operate safely under the constraints of limited computing resources and simple sensor configurations. Therefore, the challenge is to achieve a good balance of safety, availability, and drivability within the constraints of limited computing resources and simple sensor configurations.
  
- drivability

In the interior spaces of factories and warehouses, there are narrow paths that are just narrow enough for forklifts to pass through, or paths that run between equipment and shelves. In the interior spaces of factories and warehouses, there are narrow paths where forklifts can barely pass. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a function that can travel smoothly on complicated narrow paths. The need to develop a function that enables smooth travel on complex narrow paths is a major challenge.
