# autoware.core

- An [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) repository that contains a basic set of high-quality, stable ROS packages for autonomous driving.

- Although this repository is currently empty, porting of code from Universe to Core will begin once the interfaces for Autoware Core/Universe have been finalized, as per ongoing [Autoware Architecture WG](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions?discussions_q=label%3Aarchitecture_wg) discussions.
- A more detailed explanation about Autoware Core can be found on the [Autoware concepts documentation page](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts/#the-core-module).

- For researchers and developers who want to extend the functionality of Autoware Core with experimental, cutting-edge ROS packages, see [Autoware Universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe).
