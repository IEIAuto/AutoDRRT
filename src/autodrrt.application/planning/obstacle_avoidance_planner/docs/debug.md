# Debug

## Debug visualization

The visualization markers of the planning flow (Input, Model Predictive Trajectory, and Output) are explained here.

All the following markers can be visualized by

```bash
ros2 launch obstacle_avoidance_planner launch_visualiation.launch.xml vehilce_model:=sample_vehicle
```

The `vehicle_model` must be specified to make footprints with vehicle's size.

### Input

- **Path**
  - The path generated in the `behavior` planner.
  - The semitransparent and thick, green and red band, that is visualized by default.

![path](../media/debug/path_visualization.png)

- **Path Footprint**
  - The path generated in the `behavior` planner is converted to footprints.
  - NOTE:
    - Check if there is no high curvature.
    - The path may be outside the drivable area in some cases, but it is okay to ignore it since the `behavior` planner does not support it.

![path_footprint](../media/debug/path_footprint_visualization.png)

- **Drivable Area**
  - The Drivable area generated in the `behavior` planner.
  - The skyblue left and right line strings, that is visualized by default.
  - NOTE:
    - Check if the path is almost inside the drivable area.
      - Then, the `obstacle_avoidance_planner` will try to make the trajectory fully inside the drivable area.
    - During avoidance or lane change by the `behavior` planner, please make sure that the drivable area is expanded correctly.

### Model Predictive Trajectory (MPT)

- **MPT Reference Trajectory**
  - The reference trajectory points of model predictive trajectory.

![mpt_ref_traj](../media/debug/mpt_ref_traj_visualization.png)

- **MPT Fixed Trajectory**
  - The fixed trajectory points as a constraint of model predictive trajectory.

![mpt_fixed_traj](../media/debug/mpt_fixed_traj_visualization.png)

- **Boundaries' Width**
  - The boundaries' width is calculated from the drivable area line strings.

![bounds](../media/debug/bounds_visualization.png)

- **Vehicle Circles**
  - The vehicle's shape is represented by a set of circles.
  - The `obstacle_avoidance_planner` will try to make the these circles inside the above boundaries' width.

![vehicle_circles](../media/debug/vehicle_circles_visualization.png)

- **Vehicle Circles on Trajectory**
  - The vehicle's circles on the MPT trajectory.
  - Check if the circles are not so big compared to the road's width.

![vehicle_traj_circles](../media/debug/vehicle_traj_circles_visualization.png)

- **MPT Trajectory**
  - The optimized trajectory points by model predictive trajectory.
  - The footprints are supposed to be fully inside the drivable area.

![mpt_traj](../media/debug/mpt_traj_visualization.png)

### Output

- **Trajectory**
  - The output trajectory.
  - The dark and thin, green and red band, that is visualized by default.

![traj](../media/debug/traj_visualization.png)

- **Trajectory Footprint**
  - The output trajectory is converted to footprints.

## Calculation time

The `obstacle_avoidance_planner` consists of many functions such as boundaries' width calculation, collision-free planning, etc.
We can see the calculation time for each function as follows.

### Raw data

Enable `option.enable_calculation_time_info` or echo the topic as follows.

```sh
$ ros2 topic echo /planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/motion_planning/obstacle_avoidance_planner/debug/calculation_time --field data

```

### Plot

With the following script, any calculation time of the above functions can be plot.

```sh
ros2 run obstacle_avoidance_planner calculation_time_plotter.py
```

![calculation_time_plot](../media/debug/calculation_time_plot.png)

You can specify functions to plot with the `-f` option.

```sh
ros2 run obstacle_avoidance_planner calculation_time_plotter.py -f "onPath, generateOptimizedTrajectory, calcReferencePoints"
```

## Q&A for Debug

### The output frequency is low

Check the function which is comparatively heavy according to [this information](.#calculation-time).

For your information, the following functions for optimization and its initialization may be heavy in some complicated cases.

- MPT
  - `initOsqp`
  - `solveOsqp`

### When a part of the trajectory has high curvature

Some of the following may have an issue.
Please check if there is something weird by the visualization.

- Input Path
- Drivable Area
- Boundaries' Width

### When the trajectory's shape is zigzag

Some of the following may have an issue.
Please check if there is something weird by the visualization.

- Vehicle Circles on Trajectory
