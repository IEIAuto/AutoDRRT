# TensorRT Classification for Efficient Dynamic Batched Inference

## Purpose

This package classifies arbitrary categories using TensorRT for efficient and faster inference.
Specifically, this optimizes preprocessing for efficient inference on embedded platform.
Moreover, we support dynamic batched inference in GPUs and DLAs.
