## Occlusion Spot

### Role

This module plans safe velocity to slow down before reaching collision point that hidden object is darting out from `occlusion spot` where driver can't see clearly because of obstacles.

![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/occlusion_spot.svg)

### Activation Timing

This module is activated if `launch_occlusion_spot` becomes true

### Limitation

To solve the excessive deceleration due to false positive of the perception, the logic of detection method can be selectable. This point has not been discussed in detail and needs to be improved (see the description below).

### Inner-workings / Algorithms

#### Logics Working

There are several types of occlusions, such as "occlusions generated by parked vehicles" and "occlusions caused by obstructions". In situations such as driving on **road with obstacles**, where people jump out of the way frequently, all possible occlusion spots must be taken into account. This module considers all occlusion spots calculated from the **occupancy grid**, but it is not reasonable to take into account all occlusion spots for example, people jumping out from behind a guardrail, or behind cruising vehicle. Therefore currently detection area will be limited to to use **dynamic object** information.

Note that this decision logic is still under development and needs to be improved.

#### Occlusion Spot Public

This module inserts safe velocity at the collision point estimated from the associated occlusion spot under assumption that the pedestrian possibly coming out of the occlusion spot.
![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/possible_collision_info.svg)

This module consider 3 policies that are very important for risk predicting system for occlusion spot.

1. "Passable" without deceleration
   If ego vehicle speed is high enough to pass the occlusion spot and expected to have no collision with any objects coming out of the occlusion spot, then it's possible for ego vehicle to pass the spot without deceleration.

2. "Predictable" with enough distance to occlusion
   If ego vehicle has enough distance to the occlusion spot, then ego vehicle is going to slow down to the speed that is slow enough to stop before collision with full brake.
   If ego vehicle pass the possible collision point, then ego vehicle is going to drive normally.

3. "Unavoidable" without enough distance to occlusion spot
   This module assumes the occlusion spot is detected stably far from the ego vehicle. Therefore this module can not guarantee the safety behavior for the occlusion spot detected suddenly in front of the ego vehicle. In this case, slow velocity that does not cause the strong deceleration is only applied.

#### Occlusion Spot Private

This module considers any occlusion spot around ego path computed from the occupancy grid.

#### Occlusion Spot Common

##### The Concept of Safe Velocity

The safe slowdown velocity is calculated from the below parameters of ego emergency braking system and time to collision.

- jerk limit[m/s^3]
- deceleration limit[m/s2]
- delay response time[s]
- time to collision of pedestrian[s]
  with these parameters we can briefly define safe motion before occlusion spot for ideal environment.
  ![occupancy_grid](./docs/occlusion_spot/safe_motion.svg)

##### Maximum Slowdown Velocity

The maximum slowdown velocity is calculated from the below parameters of ego current velocity and acceleration with maximum slowdown jerk and maximum slowdown acceleration in order not to slowdown too much.

- $j_{max}$ slowdown jerk limit[m/s^3]
- $a_{max}$ slowdown deceleration limit[m/s2]
- $v_{0}$ current velocity[m/s]
- $a_{0}$ current acceleration[m/s]

![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/maximum_slowdown_velocity.svg)

##### Safe Behavior After Passing Safe Margin Point

This module defines safe margin to consider ego distance to stop and collision path point geometrically.
While ego is cruising from safe margin to collision path point, ego vehicle keeps the same velocity as occlusion spot safe velocity.

![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/behavior_after_safe_margin.svg)

##### DetectionArea Polygon

Occlusion spot computation: searching occlusion spots for all cells in the occupancy_grid inside "max lateral distance" requires a lot of computational cost, so this module use only one most notable occlusion spot for each partition. (currently offset is from baselink to front for safety)
The maximum length of detection area depends on ego current vehicle velocity and acceleration.

![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/detection_area_poly.svg)

##### Partition Lanelet

By using lanelet information of "guard_rail", "fence", "wall" tag, it's possible to remove unwanted occlusion spot.
![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/occlusion_spot_partition.svg)

##### Use Object Info

use object info to make occupancy grid more accurate
![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/use_object_info.drawio.svg)

##### Collision Free Judgement

obstacle that can run out from occlusion should have free space until intersection from ego vehicle
![brief](./docs/occlusion_spot/collision_free.drawio.svg)

##### Possible Collision

obstacle that can run out from occlusion is interrupted by moving vehicle.
