# MPC Lateral Controller

This is the design document for the lateral controller node
in the `trajectory_follower_node` package.

## Purpose / Use cases

<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - Why did we implement this feature? -->

This node is used to general lateral control commands (steering angle and steering rate)
when following a path.

## Design

<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How does it work? -->

The node uses an implementation of linear model predictive control (MPC) for accurate path tracking.
The MPC uses a model of the vehicle to simulate the trajectory resulting from the control command.
The optimization of the control command is formulated as a Quadratic Program (QP).

Different vehicle models are implemented:

- kinematics : bicycle kinematics model with steering 1st-order delay.
- kinematics_no_delay : bicycle kinematics model without steering delay.
- dynamics : bicycle dynamics model considering slip angle.
  The kinematics model is being used by default. Please see the reference [1] for more details.

For the optimization, a Quadratic Programming (QP) solver is used and two options are currently implemented:

<!-- cspell: ignore ADMM -->

- unconstraint_fast : use least square method to solve unconstraint QP with eigen.
- [osqp](https://osqp.org/): run the [following ADMM](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html) algorithm (for more details see the related papers at the [Citing OSQP](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/admm_distr_stats.html) section):

### Filtering

Filtering is required for good noise reduction.
A [Butterworth filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter) is used for the yaw and lateral errors used as input of the MPC as well as for
the output steering angle.
Other filtering methods can be considered as long as the noise reduction performances are good
enough.
The moving average filter for example is not suited and can yield worse results than without any
filtering.

## Assumptions / Known limits

<!-- Required -->

The tracking is not accurate if the first point of the reference trajectory is at or in front of the current ego pose.

## Inputs / Outputs / API

<!-- Required -->
<!-- Things to consider:
    - How do you use the package / API? -->

### Inputs

Set the following from the [controller_node](../trajectory_follower_node/README.md)

- `autoware_auto_planning_msgs/Trajectory` : reference trajectory to follow.
- `nav_msgs/Odometry`: current odometry
- `autoware_auto_vehicle_msgs/SteeringReport` current steering

### Outputs

Return LateralOutput which contains the following to the controller node

- `autoware_auto_control_msgs/AckermannLateralCommand`
- LateralSyncData
  - steer angle convergence

### MPC class

The `MPC` class (defined in `mpc.hpp`) provides the interface with the MPC algorithm.
Once a vehicle model, a QP solver, and the reference trajectory to follow have been set
(using `setVehicleModel()`, `setQPSolver()`, `setReferenceTrajectory()`), a lateral control command
can be calculated by providing the current steer, velocity, and pose to function `calculateMPC()`.

### Parameter description

The default parameters defined in `param/lateral_controller_defaults.param.yaml` are adjusted to the
AutonomouStuff Lexus RX 450h for under 40 km/h driving.

### How to tune MPC parameters

1. Set appropriate vehicle kinematics parameters for distance to front and rear axle and max steer angle.
   Also check that the input `VehicleKinematicState` has appropriate values (speed: vehicle rear-wheels-center velocity [km/h], angle: steering (tire) angle [rad]).
   These values give a vehicle information to the controller for path following.
   Errors in these values cause fundamental tracking error.

2. Set appropriate vehicle dynamics parameters of `steering_tau`, which is the approximated delay from steering angle command to actual steering angle.

3. Set `weight_steering_input` = 1.0, `weight_lat_error` = 0.1, and other weights to 0.
   If the vehicle oscillates when driving with low speed, set `weight_lat_error` smaller.

4. Adjust other weights.
   One of the simple way for tuning is to increase `weight_lat_error` until oscillation occurs.
   If the vehicle is unstable with very small `weight_lat_error`, increase terminal weight :
   `weight_terminal_lat_error` and `weight_terminal_heading_error` to improve tracking stability.
   Larger `prediction_horizon` and smaller `prediction_sampling_time` is effective for tracking performance, but it is a trade-off between computational costs.
   Other parameters can be adjusted like below.

- `weight_lat_error`: Reduce lateral tracking error. This acts like P gain in PID.
- `weight_heading_error`: Make a drive straight. This acts like D gain in PID.
- `weight_heading_error_squared_vel_coeff` : Make a drive straight in high speed range.
- `weight_steering_input`: Reduce oscillation of tracking.
- `weight_steering_input_squared_vel_coeff`: Reduce oscillation of tracking in high speed range.
- `weight_lat_jerk`: Reduce lateral jerk.
- `weight_terminal_lat_error`: Preferable to set a higher value than normal lateral weight `weight_lat_error` for stability.
- `weight_terminal_heading_error`: Preferable to set a higher value than normal heading weight `weight_heading_error` for stability.
