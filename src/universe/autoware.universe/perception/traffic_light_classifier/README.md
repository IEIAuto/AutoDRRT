# traffic_light_classifier

## Purpose

traffic_light_classifier is a package for classifying traffic light labels using cropped image around a traffic light. This package has two classifier models: `cnn_classifier` and `hsv_classifier`.

## Inner-workings / Algorithms

### cnn_classifier

Traffic light labels are classified by MobileNetV2.  
Totally 37600 (26300 for training, 6800 for evaluation and 4500 for test) TIER IV internal images of Japanese traffic lights were used for fine-tuning.

### hsv_classifier

Traffic light colors (green, yellow and red) are classified in HSV model.

### About Label

The message type is designed to comply with the unified road signs proposed at the [Vienna Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals#Traffic_lights). This idea has been also proposed in [Autoware.Auto](https://gitlab.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.auto/autoware_auto_msgs/-/merge_requests/16).

There are rules for naming labels that nodes receive. One traffic light is represented by the following character string separated by commas. `color1-shape1, color2-shape2` .

For example, the simple red and red cross traffic light label must be expressed as "red-circle, red-cross".

These colors and shapes are assigned to the message as follows:

## Customization of CNN model

Currently, in Autoware, [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381v3) is used as CNN classifier by default. The corresponding onnx file is [data/traffic_light_classifier_mobilenetv2.onnx](./data/traffic_light_classifier_mobilenetv2.onnx).
Also, you can apply the following models shown as below, for example.

- [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946v5)
- [ResNet](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html)
- [MobileNetV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244)
  ...

In order to train models and export onnx model, we recommend [open-mmlab/mmclassification](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification.git).
Please follow the [official document](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to install and experiment with mmclassification. If you get into troubles, [FAQ page](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html) would help you.

The following steps are example of a quick-start.

### step 0. Install [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv.git) and [MIM](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim.git)

_NOTE_ : First of all, install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) suitable for your CUDA version (CUDA11.6 is supported in Autoware).

In order to install mmcv suitable for your CUDA version, install it specifying a url.

```shell
# Install mim
$ pip install -U openmim

# Install mmcv on a machine with CUDA11.6 and PyTorch1.13.0
$ pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu116/torch1.13/index.html
```

### step 1. Install MMClassification

You can install MMClassification as a Python package or from source.

```shell
# As a Python package
$ pip install mmcls

# From source
$ git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification.git
$ cd mmclassification
$ pip install -v -e .
```

### step 2. Train your model

Train model with your experiment configuration file. For the details of config file, see [here](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/config.html).

```shell
# [] is optional, you can start training from pre-trained checkpoint
$ mim train mmcls YOUR_CONFIG.py [--resume-from YOUR_CHECKPOINT.pth]
```

### step 3. Export onnx model

In exporting onnx, use `mmclassificatoin/tools/deployment/pytorch2onnx.py` or [open-mmlab/mmdeploy](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdeploy.git).

```shell
cd ~/mmclassification/tools/deployment
python3 pytorch2onnx.py YOUR_CONFIG.py ...
```

After obtaining your onnx model, update parameters defined in the launch file (e.g. `model_file_path`, `label_file_path`, `input_h`, `input_w`...).
Note that, we only support labels defined in [autoware_auto_perception_msgs::msg::TrafficLight](https://github.com/tier4/autoware_auto_msgs/blob/tier4/main/autoware_auto_perception_msgs/msg/TrafficLight.idl).

## Assumptions / Known limits

<!-- Write assumptions and limitations of your implementation.

Example:
  This algorithm assumes obstacles are not moving, so if they rapidly move after the vehicle started to avoid them, it might collide with them.
  Also, this algorithm doesn't care about blind spots. In general, since too close obstacles aren't visible due to the sensing performance limit, please take enough margin to obstacles.
-->

## (Optional) Error detection and handling

<!-- Write how to detect errors and how to recover from them.

Example:
  This package can handle up to 20 obstacles. If more obstacles found, this node will give up and raise diagnostic errors.
-->

## (Optional) Performance characterization

<!-- Write performance information like complexity. If it wouldn't be the bottleneck, not necessary.

Example:

  ### Complexity

  This algorithm is O(N).

  ### Processing time

  ...

## (Optional) Future extensions / Unimplemented parts

<!-- Write future extensions of this package.

Example:
  Currently, this package can't handle the chattering obstacles well. We plan to add some probabilistic filters in the perception layer to improve it.
  Also, there are some parameters that should be global(e.g. vehicle size, max steering, etc.). These will be refactored and defined as global parameters so that we can share the same parameters between different nodes.
