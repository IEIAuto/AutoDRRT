# Kinematics and Dynamics Library

[![CI](https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/actions)

Orocos project to supply RealTime usable kinematics and dynamics code,
it contains code for rigid body kinematics calculations and
representations for kinematic structures and their inverse and forward
kinematic solvers.

The C++ library is located in the `orocos_kdl` folder. The installation instructions can be found in
[INSTALL.md](orocos_kdl/INSTALL.md).

The python bindings, are located in the `python_orocos_kdl` folder. The installation instructions can be found in
[INSTALL.md](python_orocos_kdl/INSTALL.md).
