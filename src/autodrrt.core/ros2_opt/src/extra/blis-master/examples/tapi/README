BLIS typed API examples
-----------------------

This directory contains several files, each containing various pieces of
example code that demonstrate core functionality of the typed API in BLIS.
These example files should be thought of collectively like a tutorial, and
therefore it is recommended to start from the beginning (the file that
starts in '00').

You can build all of the examples by simply running 'make' from this
directory. (You can also run 'make clean'.) The makefile assumes that
you've already configured and built (but not necessarily installed) BLIS
two directories up, in "../..". If you have already installed BLIS to
some permanent directory, you may refer to that installation by setting
the environment variable BLIS_INSTALL_PATH prior to running make:

  export BLIS_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local; make

or by setting the same variable as part of the make command:

  make BLIS_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local

Once the executable files have been built, we recommend reading the code in
one terminal window alongside the executable output in another terminal.
This will help you see the effects of each section of code.

This tutorial is not exhaustive or complete; many typed API functions
were omitted (mostly for brevity's sake) and thus more examples could be
written. If you've found typed functionality in BLIS and are unsure how to
use it, or if you are unsure of what additional functionality is present in
BLIS, please feel free to join and then start a discussion on the blis-devel
mailing list [1].

Thanks for your interest in BLIS!
