generic.txt
-----------

This file in 'kernels/generic' exists only to force 'git' to track what
would otherwise be an empty directory. Having this empty directory is
necessary because the 'generic' singleton family is defined in the
configuration registry as:

  generic: generic

which implies that the 'generic' sub-configuration depends on the
'generic' kernel set (because there were no complementary kernel sets
specified via '/'). Thus, we need there to be a kernel set named
'generic', but we don't actually refer to any such kernels in BLIS.
In other words, this file is simply a workaround to a quirk in the
syntax and semantics of the config_registry file.
