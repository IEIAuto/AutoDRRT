\b self_test contains the \ref self_test::TestRunner class that can be used
to sequence a set of tests to be run in order to test a device. It
advertises a self_test service. When the service is called, the \ref
self_test::TestRunner calls the tests that have been defined in order, and
combines the results into a \ref diagnostic_msgs::DiagnosticsArray. A
detailed example can be found in \ref selftest_example.cpp.
